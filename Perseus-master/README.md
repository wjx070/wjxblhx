# Perseus
Fancy name for a simple native library that patches Azur Lane scripts.  
Does not rely on offsets, so game updates shouldn't break it so long as no security measures are introduced.

**I do not intend to maintain this further. The source code can be found in the `src` branch.  
Feel free to do whatever you wish with it.**

## Loading the library
Add the following method to `UnityPlayerActivity`, anywhere above its `onCreate`:
```smali
.method private static native init(Landroid/content/Context;)V
.end method
```
And these lines to `onCreate`:
```smali
	const-string v0, "Perseus"

	invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V

	invoke-static {p0}, Lcom/unity3d/player/UnityPlayerActivity;->init(Landroid/content/Context;)V
```
(Preferably without replacing other variables, such as between `.locals 2` and `const/4 v0, 0x1`.)

## Config
Settings can be found inside `Perseus.ini`, located within the game's external files directory (`/sdcard/Android/data/{package-name}/files/`).  
If you're unsure of your region's package name, just look it up. All of them include "AzurLane" though.

Enabling the Skins mod gives you all skins in-game as if you had bought them. They are persistent between restarts.
